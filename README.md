# ancestral_roots
An application to create and visualize family tree.

## About
This is a fun little aplication I created for me to experiment on various frameworks and technologies.
The basic idea is this will be a multi tired application.
It will have two parts
- SERVICE: A backend service/api layer for this application. This is mostly an `REST` service/api, built using vaious `Java` frameworks.
- UI: A frontend for the application. This will be mostly a web application which uses `REST` api, built using mostly `Angular`

## Sections
This repo will have 2 sections as explained in `About` section. Inside each folder, there could be different folders of same purpose usig different frameworks in their respective folder.
